# bakephp
A modern, extensible, efficient, and fast revision of the cake frame work version 1.2.0.4451alpha


# content
Please read further for a project introduction, a personal introduction, a top three most asked QA, and an advisement on why I created this repo.

This is my first ever github repository, and although I 
have considered handling this several different ways 
one fun idea I had was to introduce a personal project
of mine to the general developing public, to raise some
eye brows, maybe I don't know, get a little attention
for all the right reasons. In that spirit I have taken
it on myself to consider releasing a project that has
taken on a somewhat standardized approach through it's
versions and that is my customization of a cakePHP frame
work or install et al.

In the spirit of honoring standards I thought to myself,
what use would the general public have for such a funny
idea. Probably a question even those most beloved of the
cakePHP fan base posed in self reflection over the idea,
no the concept, of reversioning and releasing a dated 
model of the frame work, no less one of the first 
versions. But I challenge, this was not done as a joke,
it's as "cool" as I would like to think it sounds, and 
interestingly enough as extensible as a any RESTful 
application of customized MVC code base needs to be.

    "Your description says 'A modern, extensible, efficient, and fast revision of the cake frame work version 1.2.0.4451alpha' .. surely, uh, i mean.."


So, why, on earth would some one want to bring version
1.2 alpha back from the depths of history to attempt a
modern take on a frame work still arguably struggling 
for it's place among beloved MVC design paradigms and
code bases. Well that's a good question, but of course
in the end I made the attempt just to see if it could
be done, and if I could be the one to do it. I also 
still maintain a certain appreciation for this design
paradigm in general over all others. In my humble 
opinion I think the cakePHP frame work represents the
best of design topologies ever realized using what is
now to date version 7 of our beloved scripting lang.,
and I will probably argue that to the end. But to be 
perfectly honest, it's boss. I mean really this IS
cool, it's fast, it's not bloated, it keeps server
RDMS queries at a minimum, it's from a time before
plugins and libraries were even really fleshed out
as official releases for this frame work, and I intend
to show how, with a proper approach to templating and
WYSIWYG almost "Wix" like inline and real time design
and development -how, the cakePHP fan base can claim
to have had the best frame work for proprietery web
DEVELOPMENT since day one, hands down, game over. The
truth is I've already showed that to myself over the 
years as a blossoming Drupal and Wordpress themer, and
now I intend to show you. And to start and yes I did
mention Wix, one might wish to begin with any version
of php from 5.2.6 through 7.1.13 to date and doing so
with no sacrifices.


    "Your first github, your first repo, your first public release of code, by posting an extremely dated version of the cake frame work??"
    
Actually it is not entirely my first public release of
code. My first release of code publicly was actually a
color spy and an mp3 player designed in Visual Basic 6
many moons ago. I then toyed with a Javascript super 
class which has since major CDN releases of jQuery and
Prototype, and nodeJS become..unnecessary, to put it
bluntly. In fact I often find myself using Skeleton and
Bootstrap with a preference of an all locally hosted JS
code base and library. I released my own library called
Jellow.lib for those seeking a RESTful approach to the
proprietery development of real estate applications and
data pulls in general, With little else interesting my
own personal proprietery development in my later career
aside from this very code base, the one I am to show off,
and module development for PHP in C, with a growing and
warranted concern for the impact nodeJS is having on all
languages, and my own blossoming interest in Ruby and 
JAVA programming in general.


    "So you're trying to show off with this. We know how to handle trolls alright! What exactly are you hoping to accomplish here?!"



In fact, I have decided to create my first repository and to truly commit to versioning my projects by publicly showing collaberative (those NDA will allow) examples starting
with this most excellent error free, efficient frame 
work that we can call, bakePHP. And with good reasons,
but in the end none better than to show case what I 
hope you will agree is true extensibility by example.,
And for those of you who don't know me my by name 
my name is Nathan Addison Stamm, I've been quietly
teaching myself web design development and server
administration for the past fourteen of nineteen
years with many collaberations with major companies,
an occasionally stable client base, and many hopes
and dreams of continuing my career path in that
regard as I have always had little need for any type
of recognition. From 2013 to 2018 I have been moving
back and forth, traveling, and breaking from any real
serious work as I reach my mid life to consider how
I will move forward. I apologize for the littany but,
I felt the aforementioned necessary before releasing
what is my first repo.


In general, I really just want to experience GitHub!
And if you are at all interested, laughing, crying, or
enticed to dive further into this repository I am sure
that saavy developers will find plenty to recommend
changes or updates to. 

# Example 1.a. - Use of routes, why /app/url/html??

If you don't like my routing, or use of routes, or 
file folder heirarchy to be blunt, you can change it!
And really it's meant to be changed.. /html/whatever
is just the default.

# Example 1.b - A config.sandbox.php file, but why??

Why do the stars twinkle! There are reasons but in 
the end it's a quite important file. Establish your
paths and definitions here and instantly you will be
able to appreciate just how extensible the core code
base is in totality.

# Example 1.c - I am used to /APP and /webroot as my
defaults

Not a problem at all. Remember what we were told by
default from our default application index.php, IF
installed in a directory layout "other than the way
it was distributed". You will note changes to base
names and paths are appropriate for this new and
refined reversion and revision. And if you risk a
problem with older PHP installs and ini_set() issues,
note where we originally set these values. Remember
that good old configuration sandbox file ?? Aha they
got a lot of people with that one, and using a custom
layout and routing structure is more of a preference,
so this really never was a paradigm issue, the entire
layout and directory structure can be made efficient
due to PREFERENCE in honor of prototyping and really,
the general nature of abstraction in it's most core
essence of concept. Push this issue further with the
right client side gui, JS code base, bring plugins 
up to standards and give your clients responsive 
design templates similar to Wordpress or Drupal and
you have a killer CMS in disguise here folks, it's
just that simple.

# Example 1.c Redux - It seems like it's just well..
separated

From what, it's original path layout and definition?
I should have mentioned the focus here is on your
own proprietery development and coding. This can be
but never was intended for cake baking as the system
has developed. Of course baking your cake app and
doing so easily and quickly through the web interface
always was a focus but that's why this is a newer
older reversioning and release. I had contemplated
for a time challenging the latest code base with a
self baking app. I decided with the right tutorials
and help files, a saavy coder can get into the core
essence using THE SAME PLUGINS and component libs
that even the latest cake frame work uses allowing
a proficient (if you are) developer to concentrate
as much on presentational logic and the topology of
their application as a themer would on aesthetic
design, I mean really ..why rebake the same cake
over and over again.

YOU are the proficient developer, set up your routes
and paths as you want them and call it your own, I
simply show one way.


    "So you're just trying to show off a CMS that  you may or may not have used in a different flavor for paid development projects you may or may not have created yourself"
    
    
Absolutely, and here I'm going to call it bakePHP. I
honestly got tired of calling it some - thing - cool
CMS when I realized what I'm introducing for free, I
sort of think showing it off as a reversioned error
free cake frame work version 1.2 alpha as I have set 
it up was enough ;)

    "And you're going to provide this all for nothing, show us it's features, it's quirks, it's differences, and it's potential as a back end for a proprietery CMS?"
    
    
Absolutely. This is just a README right now, my first
creation on GitHub., it's a pleasure to be apart of 
this community and I am still actually developing the
CMS aspect currently as a responsive fluidic inline
context editable WYSIWYG editor that is already now
working fine, but requires some attention to my own
asynchronous calls to match up to the menus it shows,
again in a very "Wix" like presentational layout of
real time editable containers. I'm very excited, but,
very strapped for time in my real life, so enjoy what
I can provide and please feel free to take any thing
you need, any way you need, any way you like, hope-
fully to benefit the greater whole. In the end, this
repo will represent the core frame work underlying
that content management system which I plan to use 
myself in my projects.
